/*
  Pitch follower

  Plays a pitch that changes based on a changing analog input

  circuit:
  - 8 ohm speaker on digital pin 9
  - photoresistor on analog 0 to 5V
  - 4.7 kilohm resistor on analog 0 to ground

  Serial.println(sensorReading);
  // map the analog input range (in this case, 400 - 1000 from the photoresistor)
  // to the output pitch range (120 - 1500Hz)
  // change the minimum and maximum input numbers below depending on the range
  // your sensor's giving:

  // play the pitch:
  tone(9, thisPitch, 10);
  delay(1);  // delay in between reads for stability
